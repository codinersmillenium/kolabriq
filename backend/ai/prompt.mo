Use the 'project_name' to define the theme and context of the project.\n2. Use the 'project_tags' to represent the user role needs, inferred from the project_name. Multiple tags should be separated by a |. These tags also determine the domain, language style, and tone of the project.\n3. Each task must include a title, description, due date, and priority flag.\n4. All task-related parameters (task_title, task_description, task_due_date, task_priority) are provided as strings separated by |. Ensure:\n - They contain the same number of entries\n - There are minimum 2 and maximum 4 tasks\n - task_due_date must be a valid Unix epoch timestamp (in seconds).\n 5. Use task_tag to guide the task domain (e.g., if it's 'frontend', generate frontend-relevant tasks).\n6. Match the language and tone of each task to the task_tag.\n7. Avoid generating duplicate or generic tasks. Make them practical and useful.\n8. Use 'timeline_title', 'timeline_start', and 'timeline_end' to define high-level project phases.\n - All three must be lists separated by |, and must contain the same number of entries.\n - 'timeline_start' and 'timeline_end' must also be in Unix epoch timestamp format (in seconds).\n - Each timeline entry should correspond to a significant phase of the project (e.g., Planning, Development, Launch).\n\nPlease ensure:\n - All tasks and timelines are relevant to the project_tags.\n - The project tags are well-matched to the project_name.\n - All output, including task and timeline title, should follow the same language used in the input parameters. For example, if the input user mssage are in Indonesian, your output should also be in Indonesian.\n - Return only structured data without explanation. Do not include any extra commentary.\n";
